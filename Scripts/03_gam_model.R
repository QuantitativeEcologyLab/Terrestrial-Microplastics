# Note: the 'partial effect' on the y-axis of the above plot represents the 
# contribution of that smooth term WRT the predicted response on the scale of
# the linear predictor (here, the log of Items_kg). The partial effect is the 
# change in the log-predicted response due to the smooth term for that term, 
# while all other variables are held constant in the model. It shows how the 
# response would change as you vary one specific variable. 
    # It is NOT the actual predicted [MP], but the contribution of this specific
    # variable to the prediction. 

    # E.g., let's say for a location at 500 meters elevation, partial effect = 0
      # and at a location at 4000 meters, partial effect = 0.3.
      # The change in elevation from 500 m to 4000 m is thus:
            # exp(0.3) â‰ˆ 1.35...
      # meaning a 35% increase in the predicted [MP], assuming all other
      # variables stay the same.
    
    # It isolates the effect of one variable after accounting for the effects 
    # of other variables -- doesn't show the full prediction, just the piece of 
    # the prediction associated to that one term.

    # All 'parital effects' together then sum to form the log of the predicted
    # response, which is then exponentiated to get Items_kg.

summary(model)
  #artificially explaining an excessive amount which impacts kriging 
  #(by a non-deterministic pattern) -
  #right now model is saying I've explained 92% - doesn't make sense given that 
  #the rest of the variables weren't explaining that much
  #partial effect on the y
