MPdf.csv is the full MP dataset that is used for all analyses. This dataset includes the locations and concentrations of MPs found in soil around the world. 

MPdf_all_papers.csv is the full dataset of all MP-soil papers. This dataset is the same as "MPdf_total.csv", but does not contain all columns (as it was too large for GitHub).

soil_data.csv contains the soil type associated with each sampled location.
